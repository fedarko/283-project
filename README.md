# CSE 283 / BENG 203 Project: Spring 2021

## `data/` source

The files located in this folder are associated with
[Zhou et al. 2019](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/38/19200). These files were
downloaded from the supplementary files on
[NCBI GEO (accession number GSE131512)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131512).

We note that, although a full replication of this work would ideally begin with
the raw sequencing data, we have begun our work starting with the gene
frequency tables derived from the sequencing data for the sake of convenience
(and due to the time constraints associated with this class project).
